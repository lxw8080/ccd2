3. **Efficient Spacing**: Reduced margins and padding on mobile
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Shortened labels, icon-only buttons where appropriate
5. **Full-Width Layouts**: Cards extend edge-to-edge on mobile
6. **Word Breaking**: Long text wraps properly without breaking layout
7. **Responsive Breakpoints**: Uses Ant Design's md breakpoint (768px)
